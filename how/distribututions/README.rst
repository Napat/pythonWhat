A sample Python project
=======================

All projects should contain a readme file that covers the goal of the project. The most common format is reStructuredText with an “rst” extension, although this is not a requirement.

Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
a good idea, although a simple "What's New" section for the most recent version
may be appropriate.
